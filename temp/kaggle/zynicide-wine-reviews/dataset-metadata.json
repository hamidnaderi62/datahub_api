The first step in this journey was gathering some data to train a model. I plan to use deep learning to predict the wine variety using words in the description/review. The model still won't be able to taste the wine, but theoretically it could identify the wine based on a description that a sommelier could give. If anyone has any ideas on how to accomplish this, please post them!\\n\\n### Content\\n\\n\\nThis dataset contains three files:\\n\\n- **winemag-data-130k-v2.csv** contains 10 columns and 130k rows of wine reviews. \\n\\n- **winemag-data_first150k.csv** contains 10 columns and 150k rows of wine reviews.  \\n\\n- **winemag-data-130k-v2.json** contains 6919 nodes of wine reviews. \\n\\nClick on the data tab to see individual file descriptions, column-level metadata and summary statistics.\\n\\n\\n### Acknowledgements\\n\\nThe data was scraped from [WineEnthusiast](http://www.winemag.com/?s=&drink_type=wine) during the week of June 15th, 2017. The code for the scraper can be found [here](https://github.com/zackthoutt/wine-deep-learning) if you have any more specific questions about data collection that I didn't address.\\n\\n**UPDATE 11/24/2017**\\nAfter feedback from users of the dataset I scraped the reviews again on November 22nd, 2017. This time around I collected the title of each review, which you can parse the year out of, the tasters name, and the taster's Twitter handle. This should also fix the duplicate entry issue.\\n\\n\\n### Inspiration\\n\\nI think that this dataset offers some great opportunities for sentiment analysis and other text related predictive models. My overall goal is to create a model that can identify the variety, winery, and location of a wine based on a description. If anyone has any ideas, breakthroughs, or other interesting insights/models please post them.\", \"keywords\": [\"alcohol\"], \"licenses\": [{\"name\": \"CC-BY-NC-SA-4.0\"}]}"
